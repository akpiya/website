# Hello World!

Per the title, this is indeed my first post in this blog. Perhaps the most apt and trite topic for the first blog post is "why a blog?" and a statement of purpose. For me, there's a very practical reason: I need to get better at writing. I've written a plenty in notebooks that I'll never read again and that will never see the light of day. While my prior process focused my tone and voice, it hasn't substantially improved my writing. I suppose one reason is that because I scribble half-baked thoughts into a notebook without ever re-reading or proofreading. From what I gather about the writing process, it is in this latter process where real progress happens. By writing in a public forum (however 'public' this blog is), I'll have to read my writing over and actually become confident in it. So as you can see, it is with noble aspirations that I start this blog. I wonder how long it'll last.

The second most trite "first blog post topic" is what I'll write about. To this, I don't have an answer besides whatever I feel like. Among more text based blog posts, I hope to make technical posts about difficult topics and interesting problems I come across. This can span Physics, Math, Probability, Computer Science, etc, pretty much whatever is challenging me at the moment. I suspect that once the school year begins, I'll write about interesting problems I come across during my studies. In fact, I already have a few topics and problems in mind. But besides technical topics, I'll also express any interesting thoughts or life updates through this blog.

With all that said, I'm excited for this new endeavour, and hopefully it proves useful to me -- and maybe someone else.
