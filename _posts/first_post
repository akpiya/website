# Hello World!

Per the title, this is indeed my first post in this blog.

Perhaps the most trite topic for the first blog post is "why a blog?" For me, there's a very practical reason: I need to get better at writing. I've written a decent amount in notebooks that'll never see the light of day. While my prior process certainly focused my tone and voice, it hasn't substantially improved my writing. I suppose one reason is that because I scribble half-baked thoughts into a notebook without ever re-reading or proofreading. From what I gather about the writing process, it is in this latter process where real progress happens. By writing in a public forum (however 'public' this blog is), I'll have to read my writing over and actually become confident in it. So as you can see, it is with noble and lofty aspirations that I start this blog. I wonder how long it'll last.

The second most trite first blog post topic is what I'll be writing about. To this, I don't have an answer besides whatever I feel like. Among more text based blog posts, I hope to make technical posts about difficult topics and interesting problems I come across. This can span Physics, Math, Probability, Computer Science, etc, pretty much whatever is challenging me most at the moment. I suspect that once the school year begins, I'll write about interesting problems I come across during my studies. In fact, I already have a few topics and problems in mind. In summary, I hope to use this blog as a means to improve my writing and consistency in solving problems.

It is important to note that this blog is heavily inspired by [Gregory Gundersen's](https://gregorygundersen.com/blog/).

With all that said, I'm excited for this new endeavour, and hopefully it proves useful to someone.
